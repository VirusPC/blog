GeoJSON
===

> GeoJSON is a geospatial data interchange format based on JavaScript
   Object Notation (JSON).  It defines several types of JSON objects and
   the manner in which they are combined to represent data about
   geographic features, their properties, and their spatial extents.
   GeoJSON uses a geographic coordinate reference system, World Geodetic
   System 1984, and units of decimal degrees.

An Example

A GeoJSON Feature Collection looks like this:
```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [{
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
          "type": "Point",
          "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
      },
      "properties": {
          "prop0": "value0"
      }
  }, {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
          "type": "LineString",
          "coordinates": [
              [102.0, 0.0],
              [103.0, 1.0],
              [104.0, 0.0],
              [105.0, 1.0]
          ]
      },
      "properties": {
          "prop0": "value0",
          "prop1": 0.0
      }
  }, {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
          "type": "Polygon",
          "coordinates": [
              [
                  [100.0, 0.0],
                  [101.0, 0.0],
                  [101.0, 1.0],
                  [100.0, 1.0],
                  [100.0, 0.0]
              ]
          ]
      },
      "properties": {
          "prop0": "value0",
          "prop1": {
              "this": "that"
          }
      }
  }]
}

```

GeoJSON Objects Overview
---

![geojson objects]({{page.resource_path}}/geojson-objects.png)

A GeoJSON object have 3 types: 
1. *Geometry*: A region of space
2. *Feature*: A spatially bounded entity, which contains a Geometry object and additional properties. (append more properties to geometry!)
3. *FeatureCollection*: A list of features

The GeoJSON object *Geometry* includes 7 types:  
1. *Point*: 0-dimentional point
2. *LineString*: 1-dimentional curve 
3. *Polygon*: 2-dimentional surface
4. *MultiPoint*: collection of *Point*
5. *MultiLineString*: collection of *LineString*
6. *MultiPolygon*: collection of *Polygon*
7. *GeometryCollection*: collection of all the other types

Notes:
1. ***Point***, ***LineString*** and ***Polygon*** are the most fundamental objects. All the other Geometry objects, even all types of GeoJSON objects, are based on them.
2. The types above are **case-sensitive**
3. The "features" and "geometries" members, respectively, of these collection objects are standard **ordered** JSON arrays, not unordered sets.


Geometry

### Geometries Except GeometryCollection

A *Geometry* (**except *GeometryCollection***) consists of two parts: ```type``` and ```coordinates```.
```json
{
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
}
```

The value of ```type``` property can be choosen from the [7 geometry types](#geojson-objects-overview) we talked above. 

The format of the value of ```coordinates``` property differs. 

Here are some definitions help to understand the following table: 
* *position*: 
  * *position* of a point is an array of numbers.
  * The first two elements are longitude and latitude, or easting and northing, precisely in that order and using **decimal numbers**. Altitude or elevation may be included as an optional third element: ```[longitude/easting, latitude/northing, ?altitude/elevation]```  
* *linear ring*: 
    * A linear ring is the boundary of a surface(exterior ring) or the boundary of a hole(interior ring) in a surface.
    * A linear ring is a **closed *LineString*** with four or more positions and its first and last positions are fully equivalent.
    * A linear ring MUST follow the **right-hand rule** with respect to the area it bounds, i.e., exterior rings are counterclockwise, and holes are clockwise.

Geometryg | coordinates Format | Example
:- | :- | :-
*Point* | a single position | ```[103.0 31.0]```
*MultiPoint* | an array of positions | ```[ [103.0, 31.0] ]```
*LineString* | an array of two or more positions | ```[ [103.0, 31.0], [104.0, 31.0] ]```
*MultiLineString* | an array of LineString coordinate arrays | ```[ [[103.0, 31.0], [104.0, 31.0]] ]```
*Polygon*  | an array of linear ring coordinate arrays (the first must be the exterior ring: ```[exterior, ...interiors]```) | ```[ [[102.0, 31.0], [103.0, 31.0], [104.0, 31.0]] ]```
*MultiPolygon* | an array of Polygon coordinates | ```[ [[[102.0, 31.0], [103.0, 31.0], [104.0, 31.0]]]] ]```

### GeometryCollection

Compared with the other geometries,  *GeometryCollection* do not have the ```coordiantes``` member and have a new member called ```geometries``` instead. It looks like this:
```json
{
    "type": "GeometryCollection",
    "geometries": [
        {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
        },
        {
          "type": "LineString",
          "coordinates": [
              [102.0, 0.0],
              [103.0, 1.0],
              [104.0, 0.0],
              [105.0, 1.0]
          ]
        }
    ]
}
```

There are some suggestions for *GeometryCollection*:
* Should not use **nested** *GeometryCollection*.
* Should not use *GeometryCollection* composed of a single part (use single part type instead) or a number of parts of a single type (use multipart type instead).

### Antimeridian Cutting

Any geometry that crosses the antimeridian SHOULD be represented by cutting it in two such that neither part's representation crosses the antimeridian. For example, if a *Polygon* across the antimeridian, it should be cutted in two and represented as a *MultiPolygon*.

Feature Object
---

A *Feature* object represents a spatially bounded thing. It has three members: ```type```, ```geometry``` (do not confused with ```geometries``` in *GeometryCollection*) and ```properties```:


```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
      "type": "LineString",
      "coordinates": [
          [102.0, 0.0],
          [103.0, 1.0],
          [104.0, 0.0],
          [105.0, 1.0]
      ]
  },
  "properties": {
      "prop0": "value0",
      "prop1": 0.0
}
```

* The value of ```type``` is always ```Feature```. 
* The value of the ```geometry``` member SHALL be either a Geometry object as defined above or a JSON null value (in the case that the Feature is unlocated).
* The value of the ```properties``` member is an object (any JSON object or a JSON null value).

If a Feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier SHOULD be included as a member of the Feature object with the name ```id```, and the value of this member is either a JSON string or number.


FeatureCollection Object
---

A FeatureCollection object has two members: ```type``` and ```features```:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [{
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
          "type": "Point",
          "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
      },
      "properties": {
          "prop0": "value0"
      }
  }]
}
```

* The value of ```type``` is always ```FeatureCollection```
* The value of ```feature``` is a JSON array. Each element of the array is a Feature object as defined above.  It is possible for this array to be empty.

Bounding Box
---

A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named ```bbox``` to include information on the coordinate range for its *Geometry*s, *Feature*s, or *FeatureCollection*s.  

* The value of it MUST be an array of length 2*n, where n is the number of dimensions.
* From the southwesterly point to the more northeasterly point.

```json
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "bbox": [100.0, 0.0, 105.0, 1.0],
    "features": [
    //...
    ]
}
```
