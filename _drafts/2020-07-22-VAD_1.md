What's Vis, and Why Do It?
===

The Big Picture
---

1. Why do it?  
    Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations on datasets designed to help people carry out taks more effectively.  

2. When to use?  
    Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.  

3. resource limitations:  
    those of computers, of humans, and of displays

4. How to analys it?  
    Vis usage canbe analysed in terms of:  
    * why the user needs it?
    * what data is shown?
    * how the idiom is designed?

5. catelog:  
    * why have a human in the decision-making loop?
    * why have a computer in the loop?
    * why use an external representation?
    * why depend on vision?


Why have a human in the loop?

Vis allows people to analyse data when tehy don't know exactly what questions they need to ask in advance.
