Functional Programming
---

Functional programming is a programming style in which software is built by **composing pure functions**, avoiding **side-effects** and using **immutable data**.

Functional programming is the process of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state**, **mutable data**, and **side-effects**.

Functional programming is **declarative** rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.
