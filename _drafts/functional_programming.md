Functional Programming
---

Functional programming is a programming style in which software is built by **composing pure functions**, avoiding **side-effects** and using **immutable data**.

Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.
