Lodash
===


* Some Lodash functions are identical to native ES6 functions — which ones should I use?　　
* Technically, it seems that the consensus online is that certain Lodash functions are actually faster than ES6 functions, but at this point this would only matter when you’re trying to optimize for obscenely large amounts of data (i.e imagine an array of 1 million elements). For general cases, the difference is often negligible.
